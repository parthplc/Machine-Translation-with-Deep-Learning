# Machine-Translation-with-Deep-Learning
A repository with python notebooks explaning Machine Translation using various Deep Learning Techniques.

# Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Machine Translation with LSTM
In this notebook, we will see how to create a language translation model which is also a very famous application of neural machine translation. 

The complete code is made from scratch without python libraries and simply pytorch.
